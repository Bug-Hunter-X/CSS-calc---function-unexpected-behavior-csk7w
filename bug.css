The CSS property `calc()` can sometimes produce unexpected results if you're not careful with operator precedence and unit consistency. For example, if you try to calculate a width using `calc(100% - 20px)`, but the parent element doesn't have a defined width, the calculation will fail and the element will not be rendered as expected.
