To fix this, ensure that the parent element has an explicitly defined width (either in pixels, percentages, or other valid units).  This provides a proper reference point for the `calc()` function to operate on.  Also, double-check your units are consistent. 

Here's a corrected version: 

```css
.parent {
  width: 500px; /* Explicit width for the parent */
}

.child {
  width: calc(100% - 20px);
}
```
By setting an explicit width on the parent element, the `calc()` function now has the information it needs to accurately calculate the width of the child element.
